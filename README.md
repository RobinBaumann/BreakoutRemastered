# BreakoutRemastered
Java implementation of the video game 'Breakout' with additional features. Homework for my computer science studies.

## Installation instructions

There should be nothing special to do in order to get the Game up and running. Just clone the Repository and import it into your favourite Java IDE, create a new Run Configuration and specify the path to the main class (Game.java).
